### Day 2: January 13, 2017 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through what I can finish today. Starting with the two assigned webpages - tribute page and portfolio page. After that I've also finished the Basic JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Today's a tough day I've coded the whole day to finishe the two sites. I opted to end the day but I still want to learn some more so I also finished the Basic JavaScript tasks in FCC.
