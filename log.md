##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 12, 2017 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Finished the HTML5 and CSS, Responsive design with Bootstrap and jQuery

**Thoughts**: I really want to learn coding, I was learning at my own pace until yesterday I found Free Code Camp by acciden, started the challenges, most of them are familiar to me but still learning some new stuffs. Hoping to continue this 100 day journey
